# Our data

To unlock the secrets of cinematic success, our research hinges on a robust and diverse dataset. At its core is the [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), a renowned collection that provides foundational details about over 80 thousands films. But if we truly wanted to understand what makes a movie succeed, we knew we needed to go deeper, much deeper.

To transform this dataset into a tool capable of answering our questions, we carefully expanded and enriched it with additional sources of information.

First, we turned to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDB</a>, a trusted platform for movie enthusiasts around the world, to understand how audiences perceived the films. From IMDB, we collected two key metrics: the ratings for each film and the number of reviews. These insights allowed us to measure not only how much people liked a movie but also how widely it was received by audiences.

Next, we turned to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDb) to explore the financial side of filmmaking. From TMDb we obtained details about each film’s such as production budget and box office revenue. In addition to financial data, TMDb provided information about the production companies behind the films, giving us valuable insights into the role that well-established studios and production houses play in shaping a movie’s fate.

Finally, to ensure our dataset was as complete as possible, we utilized [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), a structured and comprehensive online database. Wikidata helped us fill in missing details about films, including information about the cast, crew, original language, and country of origin. By cross-referencing and enriching the data, we were able to minimize gaps and build a dataset that captures the full picture of each movie.
